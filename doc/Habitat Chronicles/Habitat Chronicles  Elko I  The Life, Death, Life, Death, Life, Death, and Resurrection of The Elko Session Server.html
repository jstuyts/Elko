    In 1985 we began work on what would become one of the world's first
    multi-person graphical virtual worlds, and arguably the first of what are
    now awkwardly called "Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games"
    (MMORPGs).  Thus began a series of adventures in technology, business, and
    the online world which continue to this day.  This site is where we tell
    our story: the things we learned, the mistakes we made, the people we met,
    a tale of human brilliance and folly and things you would never have
    imagined. <br>

                <h3>Elko I: The Life, Death, Life, Death, Life, Death, and Resurrection of The Elko Session Server</h3> 
                <p> <i>Preface: This is the first of three posts telling
 the story of Elko, a new old new piece of web server infrastructure 
that I’m releasing this week as open source software.  Part I, this 
post, is a bit of personal history. There’s a companion technical story 
concerning the whats and the hows and the whys that’s fairly profound on
 its own.  But though the technical story is intimately connected to 
this one, it’s got a very different narrative.  The technical backstory 
is the subject of <a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2009/09/elko-ii-against-statelessness-or-everything-old-is-new-again/">Part II</a>, which I’ll be posting tomorrow, and a more detailed technical overview will presented in <a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2009/09/elko-iii-scale-differently/">Part III</a>, which will be up the day after tomorrow.</i></p>
<p> There is a significant piece of very cool software that, through 
circumstances largely beyond my control, I have come to write, from the 
ground up, three times.  Consequently, it’s pretty mature even though 
it’s not.  I will share the tale with you now.</p>
<p> Software incarnation #1 was done at the late lamented 
Communities.com (no relation to whoever is sitting on that domain name 
today).  It was a system called Passport that I created in 1999 and 2000
 by transmuting the server code for The Palace into a general purpose 
server for stateful applications.  It was actually the most financially 
successful thing Communities.com ever produced (used as the basis for a 
project we did for Turner Broadcasting’s Cartoon Network, called 
CartoonOrbit), but wasn’t enough to save the company. Communities.com 
crashed and burned and went off to the big IPO in the sky, ultimately 
filing Chapter 7 on March 5, 2001 (my 42nd birthday, Happy Birthday to 
me).</p>
<p> Unfortunately, there was not much we could salvage from the 
wreckage.  The IP assets of Communities.com ended up being taken over by
 one of our key investors as partial payment for a secured debt we had 
to them.  However, they were neither prepared to do anything with the 
stuff themselves nor to talk business with anybody else who might want 
to make a deal for it.  (A perfect fit to Carlo Cipolla’s <a href="http://wwwcsif.cs.ucdavis.edu/~leeey/stupidity/basic.htm">classic definition of stupidity</a>: <i>A
 stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a 
group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly 
incurring losses.</i>)</p>
<p> However, given our modest success with Turner Broadcasting, the 
survivors of Communities.com felt there was potentially a bankable 
product here. Alas, as just described, we no longer had rights to the 
code.  Consequently, this lead to software incarnation #2, which I wrote
 from scratch over the late spring and summer of 2001, based on some of 
the ideas we had in Passport and a few more we had come up with in the 
meantime.  This was 100% original Java code (the Passport server had 
been written in C), that became the basis for the company that Doug 
Crockford and I started in 2001, State Software (which Randy also joined
 a few months later).  The server and its accompanying client components
 became the State Application Framework, SAF.  Whereas Passport had 
required the installation of a special browser plugin to do magic 
network communications things, SAF was entirely HTTP-capable and the 
client was Javascript running in an unmodified browser.  This was an 
early instance of the kind of thing that is nowadays called Ajax, though
 of course nobody knew this at the time. (Basically, Crock and I can 
legitimately claim to be inventors of Ajax, along with people at 
probably 30 other companies at the same time who also invented it, 
though Jesse James Garrett gets the credit (and, let me hasten to add, 
in my opinion deserves it) because he managed to take the idea 
mainstream and gave it a cool name that stuck — kind of the way Columbus
 discovered America: lots of other people had discovered America before 
him, but after Columbus nobody else could discover it any more.)  As it 
turns out, being alienated from the fruits of our labors at 
Communities.com proved to be a blessing in disguise, since, in addition 
to being unencumbered from an intellectual property standpoint, the new 
server was vastly more capable, more flexible, more scalable, and 
phenomenally more robust.</p>
<p> State Software lasted about a year and a half before crashing at the
 end of the runway with insufficient fuel to take off.  We were a couple
 of years ahead of the market and our financial backer found himself 
unable to sustain things.  In this case, the guy was a money manager for
 another guy with a pile of money, but he turned out to be an amateur as
 a venture capitalist.  Basically, he bet almost all the money guy’s 
money on a bunch of first round investments, embezzled the remainder, 
and left nothing in the tank to provide followup support for the few 
companies that had proved promising after the first year. State Software
 (and the rest of the investor’s portfolio) collapsed into a filing 
cabinet in some lawyer’s office somewhere. Feckless VC guy eventually 
went to jail.  Once again, cool code that I had written vanished from my
 grasp.</p>
<p> Fastforward a few years and a number of colorful adventures later, 
and I find myself at Yahoo! along with Randy and Crock.  Crock and I 
were pondering various Ajax-y things then being done at Yahoo!, waxing 
nostalgic, and thinking how cool it would be to have access to the State
 Application Framework for some of the more advanced community services 
we were then contemplating.  After some tentative and unhelpful 
inquiries with the current owners of the assets about what it would cost
 to reacquire the rights (answer: for <i>you</i>, 1.5*$N, where $N is defined as the maximum <i>you’d</i> be willing to pay, regardless of who <i>you</i> are, a flagrant violation of <a href="http://www.fudco.com/chip/laws.html#business">Morningstar’s First Rule of Business</a>
 if ever there was one), we got to thinking.  Passport, software 
incarnation #1, had taken roughly two years.  SAF, software incarnation 
#2, had taken about four months (well, plus lots of follow-on tweaking 
and enhancing over the life of the company, but basically four months 
for the central code).  What if we just did it over <i>again</i> from 
scratch? We had our memories of what we’d done before, and we even had 
the API docs for SAF, which had been widely published.  Sure, it’d be 
annoying to have to go through the bother, but how hard could it be, 
really?  Well, for one thing, I didn’t have a mandate from Yahoo! to 
spend time on this, so it would have to be a personal time project.  On 
the other hand, if it worked out I might be able to leverage it into 
some things at Yahoo! that would be way more fun than what I was working
 on at the time.  So over the 2006 Christmas break I set to work on a 
project I code named Elko.  (Digression: WorldsAway was initially named 
Reno; EC Habitats, AKA Microcosm, was initially named Lodi; the working 
name for the thing I’m currently doing at WeMade is Yuma. I’ve decided 
that my personal project namespace is 
seedy-western-towns-with-four-letter-two-syllable-names.  I figure that 
with Orem, Ojai, and Moab I’ve probably got enough names to last for 
several years before I have to crack open an atlas.)</p>
<p> After two weeks of coding in what I can only describe as the most 
transcendent state of flow I’ve ever experienced, I produced software 
incarnation #3.  Like the four month initial version at State, it was 
not the whole system (and I’d end up spending a fair bit of my free time
 over the next year doing the tweaking-and-enhancing thing), but it was 
the essential central piece.  Crock and I came up with the idea of 
branding it the Yahoo Ajax Server (YAS).  He did some client-side stuff 
to show it off and we set about trying to evangelize it to the company. 
 There was some abstract interest, but planning lead times were such 
that projects were typically committed to a particular technical course 
long before hitting the problems for which this technology was the 
solution, at which point it was too late to reopen fundamental 
architectural questions.  We found we needed to be talking to people at a
 much earlier stage in the product pipeline, and the months dragged on 
as we sought the ears of the right people. Then, in February 2008, a 
wave of cost cutting swept me (and Randy) out the door, an event that 
regular (such as it is) readers of these pages know all about.  For the 
third time, I had created this piece of cool technology and then its 
shot at the big time had fallen to the vicissitudes of the business 
world before it made it into the hands of anybody who could actually do 
something productive with it.</p>
<p> Then one day a few weeks ago we were sitting around at WeMade 
thinking about real-time chat solutions for the community system we were
 developing, and I remember I’ve got this Elko thing laying around in my
 projects folder.  We could just use <i>that</i>.  And anyway, it’s good stuff, so I’ve decided to clean it up and make it available to everybody.</p>
